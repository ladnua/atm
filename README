You need maven to build the solution
mvn clean package

To run the app follow these steps:
1) go to "taget" and copy the output jar file (called like atm-1.0.0.SNAPSHOT.jar) to some another folder and rename it to atm.jar;
2) create following empty files in the folder with atm.jar: "card reader", "cash receiver", "cash dispenser" and "server db";
3) fill "server db" file with a table in CSV format where the 1st column should be card number (16 digits), the 2nd one - PIN code, the 3rd one - curent balance.
For example:

1234567890123456;1111;200
0987654321123456;2222;800
5432109876123456;3333;115

4) run in the command line "java -jar atm.jar".

The ATM program works with hardware abstractins. For each hardware device there is a file based stub implementation because there is no real device.
All work with ATM devices is done via files. For example to "insert" card into the card reader you should put 16-digit number into first line of "card reader" file.
This action will be considered as plastic card insertion into the card reader. The same about cash insertion - put a number into the "cash receiver" file to emulate real cash insertion.
The "cash displencer" file will contain amount of withdrawn cash.
When you finish working with the ATM the "card reader" will contain a number of ejected card. The same about cash receiver - if you cancel making a deposit the "cash receiver" file will
contain ejected cash amount
